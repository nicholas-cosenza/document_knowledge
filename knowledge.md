# Guide for LLM: Performing KYC Screens for Financial Crimes and Money Laundering

## Introduction

Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures are critical in financial applications to prevent financial crimes and money laundering. This guide outlines key indicators and examples to help identify suspicious activities.

## Key Indicators

1. **Mismatch in Job Title and Salary**
   - Look for discrepancies between the job title and the reported salary. For instance:
     - **Example**: If a person claims to be the CEO of Apple but reports a salary of $50,000, this is a red flag as it significantly underreports expected compensation for such a position.

2. **Inconsistent Residential and Business Locations**
   - Check for inconsistencies between the primary place of residence and the primary business location.
     - **Example**: If an individual resides in the US but operates a primary business in a sanctioned country like North Korea, this should raise concerns.

3. **Unusual Transaction Patterns**
   - Identify unusual or suspicious transaction patterns that do not align with the customer’s profile.
     - **Example**: Large, frequent international transfers that do not match the customer’s business activities or financial capacity.

4. **High-Risk Countries**
   - Be vigilant about customers with connections to high-risk countries known for money laundering or financial crimes.
     - **Example**: Transactions or business affiliations involving countries with poor AML (Anti-Money Laundering) regulations.

5. **Complex Corporate Structures**
   - Pay attention to customers using complex corporate structures to obscure the true ownership and control of assets.
     - **Example**: Multiple layers of offshore entities used to hide the beneficial owner.

6. **Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs)**
   - Monitor for transactions involving PEPs who are at higher risk of involvement in corruption or bribery.
     - **Example**: Unexplained wealth or assets disproportionate to known income sources.

## Examples of Suspicious Activities

1. **Job Title and Salary Mismatch**
   - **Case**: A customer lists their occupation as "CEO of a major tech company" but reports an annual income of $30,000.
   - **Red Flag**: Discrepancy between the high-profile job title and the relatively low salary suggests potential misrepresentation or undeclared income.

2. **Inconsistent Locations**
   - **Case**: An individual resides in Germany but conducts business operations primarily out of Iran, a sanctioned country.
   - **Red Flag**: Such inconsistencies can indicate attempts to circumvent sanctions or engage in illegal trade activities.

3. **Unusual Transaction Patterns**
   - **Case**: A small retail business frequently sends large sums of money to foreign accounts in multiple countries.
   - **Red Flag**: The volume and frequency of transactions are inconsistent with the nature of the business, suggesting possible money laundering.

4. **High-Risk Countries**
   - **Case**: A customer has business dealings with entities based in countries with known lax AML enforcement, such as Myanmar.
   - **Red Flag**: Increased risk of money laundering and financial crime due to inadequate regulatory oversight.

5. **Complex Corporate Structures**
   - **Case**: A customer uses a web of offshore companies and trusts to obscure the ownership of their assets.
   - **Red Flag**: Such structures can be indicative of efforts to evade taxes or launder money.

6. **Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs)**
   - **Case**: A PEP from a high-corruption-risk country deposits large sums of money into a personal account with no clear source of income.
   - **Red Flag**: The unexplained wealth raises suspicions of corruption or embezzlement.

## Conclusion

By closely monitoring these indicators and examples, an LLM can effectively perform KYC screens to detect potential financial crimes and money laundering activities. It is crucial to continuously update and refine the detection algorithms to adapt to evolving tactics used by criminals.
